# Codecool.io
Pet project for 7th week in Web

## Story

Drawing is fun even when you have no affinity for it. But it is even more fun when you can do it together with your friends! Our team have been playing with skribbl.io in the COVID-caranteen a lot so we decided to create our own implementation of this game.

## What are we attempting to learn?

- how to use websockets for 2-way communication between server and client
- how to use canvas for drawing
- how to work in a bigger team (11 members) efficiently
